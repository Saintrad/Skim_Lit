This project is part of the TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp: Zero to Mastery

In this notebook, I aim to replicate the deep learning approach introduced in the 2017 paper "PubMed 200k RCT: A Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts." This paper presented a groundbreaking dataset of approximately 200,000 labeled abstracts from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), designed to enable Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to classify sentences based on their sequential role in medical abstracts.

The Problem

As the number of published RCTs continues to grow, unstructured abstracts can be challenging to read efficiently. This can slow researchers down as they navigate through the vast scientific literature.

The Solution

We aim to build an NLP model capable of classifying each sentence in an abstract into its roleâ€”such as Objective, Methods, Results, or Conclusions. This capability allows researchers to skim abstracts more effectively (hence the name SkimLit) and dive deeper only when necessary.
